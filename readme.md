##### Testrail

Testrail integration with CodeceptJS is never simple like this. The test run is created automatically after the execution. The screenshots of failed tests are also attached to test results.

![Attachemnt for failed case](http://g.recordit.co/ajaa2QRlnW.gif)

##### Requirement

To use this custom plugin

```sh
npm i codeceptjs-testrail --save
```

**Note:** you should include the test case id to make it works, otherwise, this plugin has no clue which case id to be added to test run on Testrail.

An example:

```js
...
  Scenario('Search function is displayed @C12345', (I, homePage) => {
    I.seeElement(homePage.searchTextbox);
    I.seeElement(homePage.searchButton);
  });
...
```

##### Configuration

Add this plugin to config file:
  
```js
...
plugins: {
  testrail: {
    require: 'codeceptjs-testrail',
    host: 'https://peternguyentr.testrail.io',
    user: 'username',
    password: 'password or api key',
    suiteId: 1,
    projectId: 1,
    runName: 'Custom run name',
    enabled: true
  }
}
...
```

Possible config options:
  - `suiteId`: when your project is not under the single-suite mode, `suiteId` is needed. When you don't provide the `suiteId`, the first `suiteId` will be used as default.
  - `projectId` (Required): The project Id which is from the Testrail. This should be provided to make this plugin works
  - `runName` (Optional): your desired test run name. If you done provide this test run name, default test run name is as `This is a new test run on ${dd/mm/yyy H:M}` which is current day.
